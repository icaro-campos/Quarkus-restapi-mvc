# Quarkus-restapi-mvc
Repository with a restapi through quarkus.

A RestAPI with CRUD for States(estados) and Cities(cidades).

1 - You'll need to do your own import.sql on resources - Do a research about Dev Services Quarkus;

2 - To use Docker to try make containers properly, go https://docs.microsoft.com/pt-br/windows/wsl/install and do the config to WSL2;

3 - Install Docker https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/.

WARNING! -- I can't create a docker container yet. The ./mvnw package generates a file .jar in "target" fold, but a error appears to occur because a
"main" class is needed. I'm work on it.
